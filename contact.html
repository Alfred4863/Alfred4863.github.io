                    <h2>Hello, I'm Vaughn Viacrucis</h2>
                    I am 24 years old. I was born on January 24, 2001 in Davao City. I am currently studying Bachelor of Science Education Major in Computer Science at Mapuá Malayan Colleges Mindanao.

                    One fun fact about me is that I am a pet-lover. I have a shih tzu whom I hug very much like a teddy bear. I always spend my time with her. Also, I am a gamer and a dreamer. I love playing online games but not too much as exercise moderation. And I especially love Japanese dubbing of Hollywood works or other works outside Hollywood to admire Seiyuus.

                    When it comes to my study, I am a consistent to keep coping since I am thinking about despite being successful in life is not enough since I believe in God, I am always persistent about thinking of preparation before my end. While I hope to be a computer scientist under a specific field, I hope I can return to heed God's commands no excuses when they see me that I am finally a responsible person.
